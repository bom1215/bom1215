### Hello! I'm Junbeom Lee 👋  

🔭 I am a software developer specializing in Python backend engineering, with a strong interest in data.  

🍁 I currently live in Montreal, Canada.  

👨‍🏫 For three years, I worked as a teacher in Korea while pursuing programming as a hobby.  

🚀 However, my passion for creating impact through software services led me to dive into engineering.  

💡 I always enjoy connecting with new people, so feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn DM! 😊
